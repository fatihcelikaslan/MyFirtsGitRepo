//public class b7 {
//	Since we have learned constructor more in depth with inheritance, it's time to review 
//
//	In your own word answer few questions below 
//
//	1, where can a constructor be called in a class ( other than being called when object is created) ? 
//
//	hint , from this class and parent class --> ONLY CONSTRUCTOR CAN CALL 
//
//	2, what keyword do you use to call a constructor in  another constructor of same class ? -->THIS
//
//	hint , how do you call other constructors for class A in a constructor of class A? -->SUPER
//
//	3, what is the first line of any constructors if not defined otherwise by user?
//			how to change this implicit behavior?  -- BY CALLING STH ELSE
//
//	hint, what happen when Super class and Sub class both have no arg constructor 
//	and you create a Sub class object in main ?
//
//	4, since constructor is not inherited in child class , 
//	how do you call different constructors of super class? SUPER AND INTO PARANTHESIS WE PUT ARGS
//
//	5, As the title suggest , given a child class has multiple constructors ,
//
//	     is there any chance none of them call any version of super class's 
//	     constructor when user change the implicit call behavior by compiler by using this()?
//
//	hint , in a class A with 3 constructor , try to use this(args...) in 
//	constructors and see whether you can replace the call to super class's constructors in all of them.
